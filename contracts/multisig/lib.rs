//! # Multisig contract
//! This contract allows to create a multisig wallet.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The contract allows to create a multisig wallet with a list of owners and a threshold.
//! The threshold is the minimum number of approvals required to execute a transaction.
//! In order to be transparent it does not require off-chain signs and everything is being done on-chain.
//!
//! ## DISCLAIMER
//!
//! This contract is not audited and should not be used in production. Use it under your own risk.
//!
